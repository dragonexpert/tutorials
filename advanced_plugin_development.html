This tutorial is going to teach you some of the more advanced techniques in plugin development.  You should have good knowledge
of PHP and MySQL.

Topics Covered:
- $mybb->get_input
- New Setting Types
- Pagination
- Custom Pages
- Custom Online Locations
- Creating new Admin Modules
- Working with Permission Viewer
- Custom Admin Log Entries


Using $mybb->get_input:
=======================
This function has two parameters.  The first is the field name.  The second argument is numeric and can be 0 for string, 1 for integer,
or 2 for an array.

Ex. $mybb->get_input('uid', 1); /* This returns the uid that the page was accessed with and casts it to the integer type.

In 1.8.1 and newer the get_input method will still support this, but will also be able to use these instead:
[php]
$mybb->get_input('uid', MyBB::INPUT_INT);
$mybb->get_input('username', MyBB::INPUT_STRING);
$mybb->get_input('myarray', MyBB::INPUT_ARRAY);
[/php]

<b>Why should I use $mybb->get_input?</b>

The use of $mybb->get_input is preferred over $mybb->input because it will automatically typecast the value to the correct 
data type.  By default, the data type is string.  You should use this because if a person were to use parameter[]=x and your code
uses $safepid = $db->escape_string($mybb->input['parameter']) it would return a warning stating that the value passed was an array,
expected type string.  Using (int)$mybb->input['parameter'] is ok as well.

New Setting Types:
==================
A few new setting types were added to the 1.8 series of MyBB.  The first is called forumselect which builds a list 
of selectable forums for the user.  Multiple selections are allowed.  There is an option for None and All.  Another new type
is groupselect which builds a list of usergroups.  Multiple usergroups are allowed.  As of 1.8.3, no all method exists.  Lastly,
there is numeric which makes the setting an integer.


How to do Pagination:
=====================
1) Figure out how many items there are.
[php]
$query = $db->simple_select("sometable", "COUNT(primarykey) as total", "any where conditions");
$total = $db->fetch_field($query, "total");
[/php]

2) Calculate how many pages there are.

[php]
if($mybb->settings['ppp']) // Using posts per page.  tpp for threads per page
{
  $perpage = (int) $mybb->settings['ppp'];
}
else
{
  $perpage = 10; // I chose 10, but you can put what you like
}
$pages = ceil($total / $perpage);
[/php]

3) Figure out the current page.

[php]
if($mybb->input['page'])
{
  $page = $mybb->get_input('page', 1);
}
else
{
  $page = 1;
}
if($page < 1)
{
  $page = 1;
}
if($page > $pages)
{
  $page = $pages;
}
[/php]

4) Define the base url and any parameters to be passed to it.
[php]
$url = $mybb->settings['bburl'] . "/somepage.php?parameter1=$x";
[/php]

5) Now use the multipage function and put your variable in your templates.
[php]
$pagination = multipage($total, $perpage, $page, $url);
[/php]

Creating a new page
===================

1) Be sure right near the top you define the constant IN_MYBB before you do require_once "global.php".  It is also important to
initialize the variable $templatelist before this otherwise each template you use in the page will cost an extra query.

[php]
<?php
define("IN_MYBB", 1);

// This next line is optional and disables plugins on the page.

define("NO_PLUGINS", 1);
// If the page should not be shown on who's online include the following:

define("NO_ONLINE", 1);

$templatelist = "my_template1,my_template2";

// You may need to edit the next line if the page is not in your forum root directory.

require_once "global.php";

/* You can restrict page access with permissions.
* To get a full list of these permissions, look at the mybb_usergroups table.
*/

if(!$mybb->usergroup['permission_name'])
{
  error_no_permission();
}

/* You can also disallow access based on what usergroup the person is in.

$allowedusergroups = array(3,4,6); /* Default mod usergroups */
$usergroups = $mybb->user['usergroup'];
if($mybb->user['additionalgroups'])
{
  $usergroups .= "," . $mybb->user['additionalgroups'];
}
$usergroups = explode(",", $usergroups);
$allowed = 0;
foreach($usergroups as $group)
{
  if(in_array($group, $allowedusergroups))
  {
    $allowed = 1;
    continue;
  }
}
if(!$allowed)
{
  error_no_permission();
}

// To use a template you will need to use the following syntax:
eval("\$variablename = \"".$templates->get("my_template1")."\";");

/* Using caches can be beneficial if it is something that will not get changed frequently.  It saves database queries.
* You can get the data of a cache like this:
*/
$usergroups = $cache->read("usergroups");

/* The bottom of your page should finish by using the output_page function on the variable with your template that has all content on it.
* This also grants access to the debug information if that is enabled and the user has permission to view it. */
output_page($variablename);
?>
[/php]


Adding a custom online location:
================================

Adding a custom online location will require using two hooks: fetch_wol_activity_end and build_friendly_wol_location_end.
In the fetch_wol_activity_end you will need to define an activity name and return any parameters as well in an array.  
Here is an example:
[php]
function my_plugin_wol($user_activity)
{
  global $parameters;
  if(strpos($user_activity['location'], "my_file.php"))
  {
    $user_activity['activity'] = "my_file";
    // If I had any parameters I would do them like this:
    $user_activity['parameter_name'] = $parameters['parameter_name'];
  }
  return $user_activity;
}
[/php]

In the build_friendly_wol_location_end you will handle the activity you assigned it in the previous function.

[php]
function my_plugin_friendly_loc($array)
{
  global $user_activity; 
  /* Globalize $db if you want to query the database for needed parameters.  
  * Also whichever variable you cache data in needs to be globalized.
  * Globalize $cache if you are reading from a cache.
  */
  if($array['user_activity']['activity'] == "my_file") /* Replace my_file with whatever you called the activity in the previous function. */
  {
    $array['location_name'] = "html mark up of the location.  This can include a link.";
  }
  return $array;
}
[/php]
  

Creating a new Admin Module:
============================
Creating a new Admin module will take a bit of work.  First, if it needs to be in the navbar at the top, you will need to
create a new folder in your /admin/modules directory. You'll then need to create a file called module_meta.php.  It will need
to look similar to other module_meta.php files in your other modules.  If you are simply creating a new module under an existing
one, you need to use the following hooks: admin_base-module-name_menu, admin_base-module-name_action_handler, and
admin_base-module-name_permissions if you intend on forcing admin permissions. The following example will add a link under 
the menu in Templates & Style.  It will give an example of how to teach it where the code is, and how to decide what to do.

[php]
$plugins->add_hook("admin_style_menu", "theme_vars_admin_style_menu");
$plugins->add_hook("admin_style_action_handler", "theme_vars_admin_style_action_handler");
$plugins->add_hook("admin_style_permissions", "theme_vars_admin_style_permissions"); /* If you do not want to check permissions,
this line should be commented out. */

function theme_vars_admin_style_menu(&$sub_menu) /* Note that this variable is passed by reference. */
{
    $key = count($sub_menu) *10 + 10; /* We need a unique key here so this works well. */
    $sub_menu[$key] = array(
    "id" => "theme_vars",
    "title" => "Theme Variables",
    "link" => "index.php?module=style-theme_vars"
    );
}
function theme_vars_admin_style_action_handler(&$actions) /* Note that this variable is passed by reference. */
{
    $actions['theme_vars'] = array(
    "active" => "theme_vars",
    "file" => "theme_variables.php"
    );
}
function theme_vars_admin_style_permissions(&$admin_permissions)/* Note that this variable is passed by reference. */
{
       $admin_permissions['theme_vars'] = "Can Manage Theme Variables";
}
[/php]

After doing this, you will need to create your file under the correct module folder.  In this example, we would create a file
called theme_variables.php in the /admin/modules/style directory.  Failure to do this will result in a fatal PHP error.

When you need to create forms you should use the DefaultForm and FormContainer classes.  Creating tables should be done using the
TABLE class.  In the Admin CP, you do not need to use the function verify_post_check because it automatically does this
anytime it receives a POST request.

  
<h2>Making your plugin work easily with <a href="https://github.com/dragonexpert/permissionviewer">Permission Viewer</a></h2>

You may ask why you should make it work with the Permission Viewer.  Permission Viewer is a plugin that allows one to quickly 
view what permissions a member has.  It accounts for both their primary usergroup and any additional usergroups.  If your plugin
adds fields to the mybb_usergroups table, it will normally just list it as the database field which isn't always human readable.

In your _info function add the following keys: "language_file" and "language_prefix".  Language file will be the file name of the 
language file without the .lang.php extension.  The key "language_prefix" should be used if you intend on using a different name
forthe language variable than its database field.

When you are creating your language file that goes in the /inc/languages/english/admin folder, any database field created by theplugin
in the mybb_usergroups table should use your prefix followed by the database field name.  

Ex. A plugin adds the field canlockownthreads.

The plugin file should look like this:
lockownthreads_info()
{
  return array(
  // normal keys go here
  "language_file" => "lockownthreads",
  "language_prefix" => "lot_"
  );
}

Now our language file should be named "lockownthreads.lang.php".  It should look like this:
<?php
$l['lot_lockownthreads'] = "Can lock own threads?";
// any other language variables
?>

That's all there is to it.  Now it loads the language so users of Permission Viewer easily know what the permission is.

Custom Admin Log Entries:
=========================

If you have ever tried logging entries into the Admin Log you will know it gets really ugly and hard to read.

First you are going to need to hook to "admin_tools_adminlog_begin" and load your admin language.
You will then need to hook to "admin_tools_get_admin_log_action".

In that function you'll want it to look like this code borrowed from my social groups plugin:
[php]
function socialgroups_admin_tools_get_admin_log_action(&$plugin_array)
{
    global $mybb, $db, $logitem;
    if($plugin_array['logitem']['module'] == "user-social_groups")
    {
        if($plugin_array['logitem']['data']['action'] == "edit_category")
        {
            $plugin_array['lang_string'] = "admin_log_user_social_groups_manage_categories_edit_category";
        }
        if($plugin_array['logitem']['data']['action'] == "add_category")
        {
            $plugin_array['lang_string'] = "admin_log_user_social_groups_manage_categories_add_category";
        }
        return $plugin_array;
    }
}[/php]

Checking If Plugin is installed without a database query
========================================================

You can check if a plugin is installed without a database query by using this small bit of code:
[php]
function myplugin_is_installed()
global $cache;
$activeplugins = $cache->read("plugins");
// Replace myplugin with the name of the file without the extension.
if(array_key_exists("myplugin", $activeplugins['active']))
{
  return true;
}
return false;
}
[/php]
