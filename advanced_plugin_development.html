This tutorial is going to teach you some of the more advanced techniques in plugin development.  You should have good knowledge
of PHP and MySQL.

Using $mybb->get_input:
=======================
This function has two parameters.  The first is the field name.  The second argument is numeric and can be 0 for string, 1 for integer,
or 2 for an array.

Ex. $mybb->get_input('uid', 1); /* This returns the uid that the page was accessed with and casts it to the integer type.

In 1.8.1 the get_input method will still support this, but will also be able to use these instead:
[php]
$mybb->get_input('uid', MyBB::INPUT_INT);
$mybb->get_input('username', MyBB::INPUT_STRING);
$mybb->get_input('myarray', MyBB::INPUT_ARRAY);
[/php]

How to do Pagination:
=====================
1) Figure out how many items there are.
[php]
$query = $db->simple_select("sometable", "COUNT(primarykey) as total", "any where conditions");
$total = $db->fetch_field($query, "total");
[/php]

2) Calculate how many pages there are.

[php]
if($mybb->settings['ppp']) // Using posts per page.  tpp for threads per page
{
  $perpage = (int) $mybb->settings['ppp'];
}
else
{
  $perpage = 10; // I chose 10, but you can put what you like
}
$pages = ceil($total / $perpage);
[/php]

3) Figure out the current page.

[php]
if($mybb->input['page'])
{
  $page = $mybb->get_input('page', 1);
}
else
{
  $page = 1;
}
if($page < 1)
{
  $page = 1;
}
if($page > $pages)
{
  $page = $pages;
}
[/php]

4) Define the base url and any parameters to be passed to it.
[php]
$url = $mybb->settings['bburl'] . "/somepage.php?parameter1=$x";
[/php]

5) Now use the multipage function and put your variable in your templates.
[php]
$pagination = multipage($total, $perpage, $page, $url);
[/php]

Creating a new page
===================

1) Be sure right near the top you define the constant IN_MYBB before you do require_once "global.php".  It is also important to
initialize the variable $templatelist before this otherwise each template you use in the page will cost an extra query.

[php]
<?php
define("IN_MYBB", 1);

// This next line is optional and disables plugins on the page.

define("NO_PLUGINS", 1);
// If the page should not be shown on who's online include the following:

define("NO_ONLINE", 1);

$templatelist = "my_template1,my_template2";

// You may need to edit the next line if the page is not in your forum root directory.

require_once "global.php";

/* You can restrict page access with permissions.
* To get a full list of these permissions, look at the mybb_usergroups table.
*/

if(!$mybb->usergroup['permission_name'])
{
  error_no_permission();
}

/* You can also disallow access based on what usergroup the person is in.

$allowedusergroups = array(3,4,6); /* Default mod usergroups */
$usergroups = $mybb->user['usergroup'];
if($mybb->user['additionalgroups'])
{
  $usergroups .= "," . $mybb->user['additionalgroups'];
}
$usergroups = explode(",", $usergroups);
$allowed = 0;
foreach($usergroups as $group)
{
  if(in_array($group, $allowedusergroups))
  {
    $allowed = 1;
    continue;
  }
}
if(!$allowed)
{
  error_no_permission();
}

// To use a template you will need to use the following syntax:
eval("\$variablename = \"".$templates->get("my_template1")."\";");

/* Using caches can be beneficial if it is something that will not get changed frequently.  It saves database queries.
* You can get the data of a cache like this:
*/
$usergroups = $cache->read("usergroups");

/* The bottom of your page should finish by using the output_page function on the variable with your template that has all content on it.
* This also grants access to the debug information if that is enabled and the user has permission to view it. */
output_page($variablename);
?>
[/php]
