This tutorial is going to teach you some of the more advanced techniques in plugin development.  You should have good knowledge
of PHP and MySQL.

Using $mybb->get_input:
=======================
This function has two parameters.  The first is the field name.  The second argument is numeric and can be 0 for string, 1 for integer,
or 2 for an array.

Ex. $mybb->get_input('uid', 1); /* This returns the uid that the page was accessed with and casts it to the integer type.

In 1.8.1 the get_input method will still support this, but will also be able to use these instead:
[php]
$mybb->get_input('uid', MyBB::INPUT_INT);
$mybb->get_input('username', MyBB::INPUT_STRING);
$mybb->get_input('myarray', MyBB::INPUT_ARRAY);
[/php]

How to do Pagination:
=====================
1) Figure out how many items there are.
[php]
$query = $db->simple_select("sometable", "COUNT(primarykey) as total", "any where conditions");
$total = $db->fetch_field($query, "total");
[/php]

2) Calculate how many pages there are.
[php]
if($mybb->settings['ppp']) // Using posts per page.  tpp for threads per page
{
  $perpage = (int) $mybb->settings['ppp'];
}
else
{
  $perpage = 10; // I chose 10, but you can put what you like
}
$pages = ceil($total / $perpage);
[/php]

3) Figure out the current page.

if($mybb->input['page'])
{
  $page = $mybb->get_input('page', 1);
}
else
{
  $page = 1;
}
if($page < 1)
{
  $page = 1;
}
if($page > $pages)
{
  $page = $pages;
}
[/php]

4) Define the base url and any parameters to be passed to it.
[php]
$url = $mybb->settings['bburl'] . "/somepage.php?parameter1=$x";
[/php]

5) Now use the multipage function and put your variable in your templates.
[php]
$pagination = multipage($total, $perpage, $page, $url);
[/php]
