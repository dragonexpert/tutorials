How To Run A Successful Community

1) The most important thing is to make sure what you want your community to be about is something you have interest in.  You will automatically
be more motivated to perform essential tasks this way.  You should also choose something that doesn't have tons of communities that already exist.

2) Use a proper top level domain if you want it to grow.  Don't use a domain name like something.tk.  Use .com when available or .net. 
People will tend to remember better if it is a .com or .net also.  Make sure the domain name also isn't extremely long or visitors will
forget the url.  By having a relevant domain name and having it be a .com or .net you will have a better SEO score.

3) Don't use free web hosts.  Many of them have bad uptime because they overload their servers.  They also tend to automatically place ads on
your site to help them cover costs.  Free web hosts may also be more restrictive on resource consumption or disabling certain PHP functions.  If 
things are breaking because of those restrictions or uptime is bad, you'll lose visitors.

4) Content is a big key on getting visitors.  You need to be creating unique content on a regular basis.  You shouldn't just let that be the
work of visitors.  It also helps your SEO score so others can find your website easier.

5) Use friendly urls.  This means you should try and have links with urls that use words rather than a random id.  Some forum softwares
have this functionality as a plugin.  You can also use Rewrite Rules in a .htaccess file so you can have pretty urls.

6) Listen to your users.  Remember that it isn't always about you.  It is about making the website better for everyone.  Sometimes this
means creating a balance between features and performance.  You may find a plugin that does something really cool for your website, but
if it makes it really slow, it isn't worth it.  Slow page load times will cause you to lose potential members.

7) Don't make too many members moderators.  This is a common problem, especially with smaller websites.  There isn't a magic formula
that works for every community, but in general you shouldn't have more than 2 moderators if you only have 50 - 100 members that are
regular visitors.  If you can't name every moderator on your website, you probably have too many.

8) Make sure your moderators are active.  They can't just post only in staff only areas of your website.  It will make the moderator seem
both distant and undeserving to others.

9) Don't overmoderate content.  You shouldn't have moderators lock topics unless absolutely necessary.  It is killing a discussion that
members can participate in.
